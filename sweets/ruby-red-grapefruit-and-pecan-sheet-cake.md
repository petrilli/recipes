# Ruby Red Grapefruit & Pecan Sheet Cake

Yields: 16-20 servings

## Cake

### Ingredients

* 16Tbsp unsalted butter (2 sticks)
* 1/2C Ruby Red grapefruit juice
* 1/2C water
* 2C AP flour, sifted
* 2C granulated sugar
* 1tsp baking soda
* 1/2tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4tsp kosher salt
* 1C roasted pecans, roughly chopped
* 2Tbsp Ruby Red grapefruit zest
* 1/2C buttermilk
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 1tsp vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat the oven to 375F and grease and flour a 9x13 pan or a 
15x10x1-inch jellyroll pan.

In a small pan on low heat, melt the butter with the Ruby Red 
grapefruit juice and water.

Mix together the flour, sugar, baking soda, cinnamon and salt. Stir in 
the pecans and grapefruit zest. Pour in the melted butter, along with 
the buttermilk, eggs and vanilla extract. Mix until a smooth batter is 
formed.

Pour the batter into the greased and floured pan, and bake for 25-30 
minutes, checking it at 20 minutes, or until the cake is lightly browned
and an inserted knife or toothpick comes out clean. (If using a j
ellyroll pan, it should take about 20 minutes, so check it at 15 
minutes.)

* 8oz cream cheese, softened
* 4Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
* 2Tbsp Ruby Red grapefruit juice

touch (about an hour or so), frost the cake.
