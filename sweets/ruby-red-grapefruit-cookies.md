# Ruby Red Grapefruit Cookies

Yields: 24 cookies

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2C sugar, plus more for dipping
* 8Tbsp butter, softened
* 1 large egg, beaten
* 1tsp vanilla extract
* 2Tbsp Ruby Red grapefruit juice
* 1Tbsp Ruby Red grapefruit zest
* 2C all-purpose flour
* 2tsp baking powder
* 1/2tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/4tsp kosher salt
* Pinch of ground ginger

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 350F and either lightly grease or line a baking 
sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. 

Cream together the sugar and the butter until well combined. Stir in the 
egg, vanilla extract, grapefruit juice, and grapefruit zest until well
combined. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon, salt, and 
ginger and then combine with the liquid ingredients until a soft dough 
is formed. (This is supposed to be a soft dough, but if you find it’s 
too soft then chill it for 15 minutes before proceeding.)

Pour some granulated sugar into a bowl and then form the dough into 
tablespoon-sized balls. Dip each dough ball into the sugar and then 
place on the sheet 2-inches apart, as they’ll spread as they bake. 
Bake one sheet at a time for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are just 
set. They’ll be puffy when they come out of the oven but as they cool 
they’ll flatten and form those glorious cracks in the surface. Continue 
for the rest of the dough.
