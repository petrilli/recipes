# Raspberry, Lime and Ginger Soda

## Ingredients

* 20oz fresh blackberries, rinsed
* 2C water
* 7oz sugar
* 2 limes, washed and juiced
* 2 1/4" sliced of fresh ginger
* Carbonated water

## Instructions

Place the blackberries and the water into a medium saucepan, set over 
medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 
for 15 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat and pour the mixture 
into a strainer lined with cheesecloth that is set in a large bowl. Allow 
to cool for 15 minutes, then squeeze out as much of the liquid as possible. 
Discard the skin and pulp.

Return the blackberry juice to the saucepan along with the sugar and lime 
juice. Place over medium-high heat and stir until the sugar has dissolved. 
Bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and transfer 
to a heatproof glass container and place in the refrigerator, uncovered, 
until completely cooled. Seal container.

*To Serve:* Combine 1/4C of the liquid with 8oz of carbonated water and serve over ice.
