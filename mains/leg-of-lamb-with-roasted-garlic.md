# Leg of Lamb with Roasted Garlic

## Ingredients

* 5-7# boneless leg of lamb with sirloin muscle removed (American cut)
* 1/4C kosher salt 
* 1/4C granulated sugar
* 12 cloves garlic, crushed
* 2 medium heads garlic
* 1T olive oil
* 2T fresh parsley leaves, minced
* 3T vegetable oil
* Kosher salt and ground black pepper

## Instructions

Combine 1/4C salt, 1/4C sugar, and crushed garlic with 2 quarts water in
large bowl or container; stir until salt and sugar dissolve. Trim lamb,
removing silverskin and excess fat. Submerge lamb in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 1-2 hours.

While lamb brines, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 
400 degrees. Cut tops off garlic cloves, and remove outer paper. 
Wrap garlic heads in aluminum foil and drizzle with olive 
oil. Wrap foil tightly around garlic; place on baking sheet and roast 
until cloves are very soft, 40 to 45 minutes. 

When cool enough to handle, squeeze garlic head to remove cloves from 
skins. Mash cloves into paste with side of chef's knife. Combine 2 tablespoons garlic paste and parsley in small bowl.  Reserve remaining
for a pan sauce.

Remove lamb from brine and pat dry with paper towels. Season roast with 
salt and pepper. Heat vegetable oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet over 
medium-high heat until shimmering. 

Place lamb roasts in skillet and cook until well browned on all sides, 
about 12 minutes total. Place skillet in oven and roast until center of 
roast reads 125-130 degrees for medium-rare to medium.

Let lamb rest, tented with foil, about 15 minutes. Snip twine off 
roasts, cut into 1/4-inch slices, and serve.
