# Sonoran Pot Roast Pie with Cheesy Cornbread Crust

While this is based on another recipe, the techniques and such have
been adjusted to better reflect my own preferences, and laziness. I've
also increased the beaniness (is that really a word?) to better
address the balance I think it should have.

## Ingredients

### Beef layer
* 1Tbsp peanut oil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 1/2lb whole boneless beef chuck
* 1 medium onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
* 12oz light-flavored beer (I used a pilsner)
* 16 ounces jarred or homemade tomatillo salsa
* 6 sprigs thyme
* 1.5g xanthan gum (optional)
* 1g soy lecithin (optional)

### Bean Layer

* 2 15oz cans pinto beans, drained and rinsed
* 4oz can of green chilis (or fire-roasted jalapeños)
* 5 slices of bacon, cooked and crumbled
* 1/2C Mexican crema (or sour cream)
* 1/2C chopped fresh cilantro (parsley can be substituted)
* 2Tbsp fresh lime juice

### Cheese layer

* 1/2C extra-sharp cheddar, shredded

### Cornbread top

* 2/3C yellow cornmeal
* 1C AP flour
* 2tsp sugar
* 1tsp baking soda
* 2/3C milk (or buttermilk, and increase baking soda by 1/2tsp)
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten
* 3Tbsp unsulated butter, melted
* 1/2C corn kernels (fresh or frozen, thawed)
* 1/4C pepper jack cheese, shredded
* 1/4C extra-sharp cheddar, shredded

## Instructions

Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 325°F.

For the Beef Layer (oven): Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large
Dutch oven. Season meat liberally with salt and pepper. When oil is
shimmering, sear meat on both sides until nicely browned, about 7
minutes total. Remove the meat. Reduce heat to medium and add onions and
garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until just beginning to soften, about
3 minutes. Add beer and bring to a boil, scraping any browned bits from
the bottom of the pot. Return meat to pan, add salsa and thyme and
return to a boil. Cover and transfer to the oven to cook until a fork
shows no resistance when inserted, 2 to 3 hours.

For the Beef Layer (pressure cooker): Heat oil over medium-high heat in
a 6.5qt or larger pressure cooker. Season meat liberally with salt and
pepper. When oil is shimmering, sear meat on both sides until nicely
browned, about 7 minutes total. Remove the meat. Reduce heat to medium
and add onions and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until just
beginning to soften, about 3 minutes. Add beer and bring to a boil,
scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Return meat to
pan, add salsa and thyme and return to a boil. Cover, and bring to high
pressure (15psi), then reduce temperature to barely maintain pressure
and cook fof 35 minutes. Remove from heat, and allow pressure to drop
naturally, or run under cold water in sink to accelerate the drop.

For the  Bean Layer: When meat nears the end of cooking time, place
beans in a large bowl and gently mash, taking care to leave some
texture. And canned chiles, bacon, sour cream, cilantro, and lime juice
and stir to combine. Set aside.

For the Crust: Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking soda, milk, eggs,
melted butter, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl. Whisk with a fork
until just combined and lump-free. Fold in corn kernels, pepper jack
cheese, and 1/4 cup cheddar cheese. Set aside.

When meat is finished cooking, remove. Discard thyme sprigs. Transfer
pot roast to a platter and tear meat into small chunks or shreds,
discarding any unappealing fatty bits. Optionally, use an immersion
blender to blend all the chunks, and then dissolve and integrate the
soy lecithin and xanthan gum.

Return meat to pot and stir with juices to combine. The meat should be
well-coated and saucy, not stew-like. Taste and adjust seasonings, if
necessary.

Spray cooking spray on inside of individual baking crocks or a 9x13"
baking dish. If using crocks, spread an even portion of meat on the
bottom of dishes. Top with equal portions of the bean mixture, followed
by a layer of cheddar cheese from the remaining 1/2 cup you have on
hand. Top with cornmeal mixture and spread evenly over the cheese using
a spatula.

Place in oven and bake until browned and bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes for
individual servings, and 45 minutes for 9x13 baking dish. Serve with
Mexican crema and additional limes, if desired.
