# Texas-style Brisket Rub

One might, quite legitimately, argue that barbeque brisket is the
"national dish of Texas". Still, even with such a powerful warning,
I have to tell you that *every* pitmaster has their own rub, and they
are considered the most sensitive of information. This is mine, you
should feel free to have your own, and in-fact, I insist.

My use of sugar here might be consider herasy, but so be it. I like it.

## Ingredients

* 1/3C kosher salt
* 1/3C fresh-ground black pepper
* 1/3C paprika
* 1/4C light brown sugar
* 1/4C crushed red chili flakes (I actually prefer deolmaewoon gochugaru)
* 1/4C garlic powder
* 1/4C onion powder

## Instructions

Mix everything together, and store in a air tight container. It should
keep for a few weeks if you are careful without any noticable 
degredation, though the brown sugar may get dry.

To use, just rub the brisket with a little neutral oil (I usually use
peanut oil), and then sprinkle *liberally* with the rub. Allow to sit
a minimum of 1hr before smoking, but up to 24 hours is acceptable.
