# Roasted Carrot Soup

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2# carrots, peeled and sliced 1/2" thick
* 1 medium onion, halved and sliced 1/2" thick
* 2tsp vegetable oil
* 1/2tsp kosher salt
* 3 garlic cloves, minced
* 1/4C dry white wine
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 1/2C low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 1/2C water
* 1/2C half-and-half
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 450F degrees. Toss the carrots, onion, 1tsp of
the oil, and 1/2tsp salt on a rimmed baking sheet and then spread in
an even layer. Roast until the vegetables are well browned and
softened, stirring occasionally, 25 to 30 minutes.

Transfer the roasted vegetables to a large saucepan. Add the
remaining 1tsp oil, cover, and cook over medium-low heat, stirring,
until the carrots soften further, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and
cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine and bay leaf.
Cook until the wine has reduced by half, about 1 minute. Add the broth
and water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; cover, reduce the
heat to medium-low and simmer until the soup is flavorful, about 5
minutes.

Puree the mixture until smooth. Add the half-and-half and warm over
low heat until hot, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to
taste.
